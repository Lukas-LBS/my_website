<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>The graphs above show the possible relationships between CPI and the 10 year Treasury yield. The graphs from the original source are all on the same scale and use different numbers on the axis, while our graphs utilize the same scale on both axis. This is allows us to better understand the relationships and trends occurring from the 1980s to the 2020s more clearly. For example, in the 1980s, the 10 year Treasury rate was much higher, and there was a corresponding higher CPI yearly change. Looking at the present day where the 10 year Treasury rate is extremely low, we can easily see the corresponding lower CPI yearly change through our graphs. In the 1980s, the spread of yearly CPI change was the greatest from 0.02 to 0.12. This is most likely due to the varying economic policies of presidents during the decade. Carter’s administration saw very high levels of inflation and when Reagan came into office, he worked to try and implement policy hat would unwind this. Volcker, as chairman of the Fed, worked with the rest of the board to reduce inflation from its peak of 13.5% to almost 3% by 1983.</p>
