# Temperature change

We want to explore data on climate change and if temperatures are actually rising. To do so we first need to load the following dataset and manipulate it so we can work on it:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

```{r tidyweather}

#select the year and the twelve month variables from dataset
tidyweather <- select(weather, "Year", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, #select the monthly columns and convert the data frame from 'wide' to 'long' format
               names_to = "month", #name the new column "month"
               values_to = "delta") #name the new values under "delta"

glimpse(tidyweather)

```

Following our data manipulation, we want to visualise how temperatures evolved:

```{r scatter_plot}

#create new variable
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))
#create time-series scatterplot
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") + #add trendline
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

#create scatterplots per month
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") + #add trendline
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~month) #group by month

```

In December-March, the data sets are a bit more spread out and in the more recent years there appears to be a more pronounced and steep upward trend in the temperature. However, this upward trend is seen in all the months to some extent. More critical to observe, is the increase over the years where it can be observed that the increase in temperature is beginning to take on an exponential upward curve - scary! In the the prior graph, with all the data points together, there is a clear upward trend in increasing temperature, becoming especially prominent around 1975.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in.

To simplify our analysis, we will look at data of decades now:

```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

We will create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in:

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) + #density plot with transparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() + #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

This graph is a clear indicator that the change in temperature has been steadily increasing from the 1880s. This is seen through the movement of the curves to the right.

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we are also interested in average annual anomalies:

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(na.rm = TRUE, 
            annual_average_delta = mean(delta)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         

```

The yearly averages above also provide convincing evidence to show the rise in temperatures across time.

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

We will construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation:

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

#constructing a confidence interval utilizing a formula
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval =="2011-present") %>% # choose the interval 2011-present
  summarise( # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
    min_delta = min(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
    q25_delta = quantile(delta, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE),
    median_delta = median(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
    q75_delta = quantile(delta, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE),
    max_delta = max(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
    mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
    sd_delta = sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
    count=n(),
    t_critical = qt(0.95, count-1),
    se_delta = sd_delta/sqrt(count),
    margin_of_error = t_critical*se_delta,
    lower= mean_delta-margin_of_error,
    higher=mean_delta+margin_of_error)
    #calculate upper end of CI
   # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
                      
#print formula_ci
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}
set.seed(1234)

boot_weather <- comparison %>% 
  #select interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  #Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = delta) %>% 
  #Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  #Construct 95% CI
  calculate(stat = "mean")

#Run CI
boot_weather %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95, type = "percentile")

```

In this problem, we created a 95% confidence interval for the average annual delta (change in temperature) from 2011 to the present. Two methods were utilized to construct the interval: formulas and a bootstrap simulation, which generated the same result. From analyzing this confidence interval, we are 95% positive that the interval from 1.02 to 1.11 captures the true mean value of the delta or change in temperature from 2011 to the present. Essentially, from 2011 to the current day, the change in temperature has been an increase of over 1 degree Celsius. This is extremely troubling because in the past a one degree drop was enough to put the earth into a Little Ice Age so just imagine what a one degree increase over just ten years has done to the planet!
