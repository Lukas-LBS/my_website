# Pay Discrimination

To understand if the pay gap is caused by gender or experience, we first load data from Omega Group plc on this:

```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. 

We first calculate summary statistics on salary by gender to get an overview of the data. For the same reason, we also create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, we show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval.

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

#create dataframe
salary_gender <- omega %>% 
  #group by gender (male-female) to have two rows
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  #add summary statistics and confidence interval endpoints
  summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary),
            sd_salary = sd(salary),
            count=n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_salary = sd_salary/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se_salary,
            lower = mean_salary-margin_of_error, #include confidence intervals
            higher = mean_salary+margin_of_error)
#print dataframe
salary_gender

#conduct correlation analysis
biserial.cor(omega$salary, omega$gender)

```

The above analysis provides us with the lower and upper bounds of a 95% confidence interval for salaries, based on gender. From an initial glance at this data, we observe that the intervals do not overlap, a signal that further analysis should be conducted to determine if this difference between salary and gender is statistically significant. The biserial.cor function allowed us to calculate the correlation between a dichotomous variable (male, female) and salaries. The correlation came out to -0.508, signifying that the two variables are relatively related but in a negative way.

We also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(1234)

salary_vs_gender <- omega %>% #pull from main dataframe
  
  #specify variable of interest
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>% 
  
  #hypothesize a null of zero difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  
  #generate a bunch of simulated samples
  generate(reps=1000, type="permute") %>% 
  
  #find the mean difference of each sample
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", 
            order = c("male", "female"))

salary_vs_gender %>% visualize()
salary_vs_gender %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = (73239-64543), direction = "both")

```

From the two hypothesis tests, it can be concluded that there is a significant difference among salaries based on gender (male vs female).
In the two sample t-test, the resulting t-stat was -4 and the p-value was way below 0.05 at 2e-04. Additionally, the confidence interval did not contain zero. These three statistics, tell us to reject the null hypothesis, which was that the difference in salaries was not related to gender. Finally, the hypothesis test using the infer package, also led to a p value of 0, confirming our above conclusion. 

We will look at experience data now:

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

#create dataframe
gender_exp <- omega %>% 
  #group by gender (male-female) to have two rows
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  #add summary statistics and confidence interval endpoints
  summarise(mean_exp = mean(experience),
            sd_exp = sd(experience),
            count=n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_exp = sd_exp/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se_exp,
            lower = mean_exp-margin_of_error, #include confidence intervals
            higher = mean_exp+margin_of_error)
#print dataframe
gender_exp

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(1234)

gender_vs_exp <- omega %>% #pull from main dataframe
  
  #specify variable of interest
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>% 
  
  #hypothesize a null of zero difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  
  #generate a bunch of simulated samples
  generate(reps=1000, type="permute") %>% 
  
  #find the mean difference of each sample
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", 
            order = c("male", "female"))

gender_vs_exp %>% visualize()
gender_vs_exp %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = (21.12-7.38), direction = "both")

```

This data seems to tell us that there is a significant difference between the experience of male and female executives. Some of the main statistics in the output that led us to this conclusion were the t-stat of -5, p-value of 1e-05, and the 95% confidence interval not containing zero. Unfortunately, this conclusion endangers our early conclusion that the difference in salaries among executives was based on gender. Now, further analysis is required to see if it is because of only gender, or if it is because male executives tend to have more years of experience than female executives. 

We want to draw a scatterplot to visually understand the relationship between salary and experience:

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
ggplot(omega, aes(x=experience, y=salary)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=gender)) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Salary vs Experience in the Workplace",
       x="Years of Experience",
       y="Salary") +
  theme_minimal()

```


This scatterplot shows the upward trending slope where more years of experience typically equates to a higher salary. Additionally, with the colored dots, it is possible to see that women tend to less years of experience compared to the men, but the women who do have equivalent higher years of experience as men tend to be paid in a similar range.

To statistically draw conclusion, however, we also want to look at correlation:

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% dplyr::select(gender, experience, salary) %>%  #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

Men have sifnificantly more experience in the workplace as their experience boxplot does not overlap with that of females. This also results in a higher median salary as a result, however with wage, the boxplots for male and female are overlapping so its unsure if there is a statistically significant difference in male vs. female salaries.
