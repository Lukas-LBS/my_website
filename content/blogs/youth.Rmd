# Characteristics of students and their propensity to participate in physical activities

### To understand this relationship, we first need to load the data with te following code


```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(yrbss)
```

We first start with analyzing the `weight` of students in kilograms.

```{r, eda_on_weight}

yrbss %>%
  filter(!weight == "NULL") %>% 
  summary()

ggplot(data=yrbss,aes(x=weight))+geom_histogram()+labs(title = "Distribution of Weights")

```

Next, we consider the possible relationship between a high schoolerâ€™s weight and their physical activity. To receive a quick overview, we plot the data.

To do so we create a new variable `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus`, which will have the value `yes` if the student is physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. We also calculate the number and proportion of students who are and are not active for more than 3 days:

  
```{r, mutate_and_count}
yrbss <- yrbss %>%
  filter(!physically_active_7d == "NULL") %>%   
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d>= 3,"Yes", "No")) 

#percentage of not active for >3 days, using count()

Total_observation <- data.frame(yrbss$physically_active_7d)
percentage_not_active <- count(yrbss$physical_3plus =="No")/count(Total_observation)
percentage_not_active

#percentage of not active for >3 days, using Groupby() & Summarise()

physical_3plus = data.frame(yrbss$physical_3plus)

data2 <- yrbss %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(VALUES= n())

percent= data2[1,2]/sum(data2$VALUES)
percent


```

To statistically examine the the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week, we create a 95% confidence interval:

```{r}
  
  se_notactive <- sqrt(percent*(1-percent)/sum(data2$VALUES))
  t_value <- qt(0.95, sum(data2$VALUES)-1)
  Lower_range <- percent-t_value*se_notactive
  Upper_range <- percent+t_value*se_notactive
  
  c(Lower_range, Upper_range)
  
```
  
We can see that almost a third of schools are not active 3 or more days per week!
  
When we create a boxplot to see if individuals that are active 3 or more days per week correlates has to do with  `weight`, we surprisingly see that this is not the case

```{r, boxplot}
ggplot(yrbss, aes(x=physical_3plus,y=weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
#expect people with more exercise have a lower median weight. But the result is quite the opposite
```

## Confidence Interval

```{r, ci_using_formulas}
yrbss %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight=mean(weight,na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_weight=sd(weight,na.rm=TRUE),
            count=n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.95, count-1),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se_weight,
            lower= mean_weight-margin_of_error,
            higher=mean_weight+margin_of_error)

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.
