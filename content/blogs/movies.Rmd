### Relationship between the number of Facebook likes a movie received and its revenues

To examine this relationship, we first need to load the data through the command shown below:

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Following this, we produce a scatter plot to show the relationship in question:

```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
#Create scatterplot
ggplot(movies, aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y=gross)) + #assign x- and y-axis variables 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  scale_y_log10()+
  scale_x_log10() + #scale axis to make graph readable
  labs(title = "Gross Revenue of Movie vs Cast Facebook Likes",
       x="Cast Facebook Likes",
       y="Gross Revenue") 
```

In addition, we also test for the correlation to understand if any relationship we can see in the scatter plot holds statistically.

```{r, gross_on_fblikess}
#Test correlation of variables
cor(x=movies$cast_facebook_likes, y=movies$gross)
```

#### Interpretation

The number of facebook likes that a cast receives is not likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office, as seen through the lack of correlation in the graph and the correlation test. Since we were testing if gross revenue is *dependent* on the number of facebook likes, gross revenue became the dependent variable (y-axis) and facebook likes became the independent variable (x-axis).

### Relationship between a movie's budget and its revenues

The next interesting relationship to understand is whether movies with higher budgets make more money. To test for this we will again create a scatterplot:

```{r, gross_on_budget}
#Create scatterplot
ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, y=gross)) + #assign x- and y-axis variables
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  scale_y_log10()+
  scale_x_log10() + #scale axis to make graph readable
  labs(title = "Gross Revenue of Movie vs Movie Budget",
       x="Movie Budget",
       y="Gross Revenue") 

#Test correlation of variables
cor(x=movies$budget, y=movies$gross)

```
#### Interpretation

Through the scatterplot we can assume that the budget can be a good predictor of how much money the movie will make. This makes sense since movies with bigger budgets tend to have more popular casts, better quality production, and more marketing campaigns.
