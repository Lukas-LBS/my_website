Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

In May and June, we see a flattening of the distribution curve. In the prior years for the months of May June, there is usually a relatively normal distribution of the graph, with a a bit of skew and some years where the distributions are bi- or tri-modal. In 2020, I believe we are seeing a widening of the distribution away from a concentrated mean amount of bike rentals. This is most likely because of the lockdown over the summer due to the pandemic. When lockdown restrictions were lifted, there would be high levels of bike rentals but going back into lockdown would cause these rentals to drop significantly, and hence "stretches" the distribution out as seen in the graph above. 

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

#create data.frame that contains the actual monthly average for each of the 6 years
actual_data_bike <- bike %>% 
  filter(year > 2015) %>% 
  group_by(month, year) %>% 
  summarise(actual_rental = mean(bikes_hired)) #create actual rental variable

#create data.frame that contains the monthly average over the 6 years  
total_data_bike <- bike %>% 
  filter(year > 2015) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(expected_rental = mean(bikes_hired))#create expected rental variable

#create final data.frame that contains both the actual and expected variables  
final_bike <- left_join(actual_data_bike,total_data_bike) %>% 
    mutate(excess_rentals = actual_rental - expected_rental, #create excess rental variable
           up = ifelse(actual_rental>expected_rental, excess_rentals, 0),
           down = ifelse(actual_rental<expected_rental, excess_rentals, 0))

#replicate graph from picture

```

The graph we created shows the monthly changes in bike rentals for TfL. The expected rental variable we created came from monthly data for the entire year range from 2016-2019. The actual rental variable we created was the true average for each month of every year. We then created an excess rentals variable that was the difference between the actual and expected rentals; this is what is shown in the graph.The blue line is the the expected rentals per month, and is the same in each year. The differences from this expected value are displayed in red or green, depending on if the actual number of bike rentals was above or below this line.

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. 

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

#create data.frame that contains the actual monthly average for each of the 6 years
actual_data_bike_weekly <- bike %>% 
  filter(year > 2015 & week < 53) %>% #filter for after year 2015 and before week 53 (which skews data if used)
  group_by(week, month, year) %>% 
  summarise(actual_rental_weekly = mean(bikes_hired)) #create actual rental variable

#create data.frame that contains the monthly average over the 6 years  
  total_data_bike_weekly <- bike %>% 
  filter(year > 2015 & week < 53) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(expected_rental_weekly = mean(bikes_hired)) #create expected rental variable

#joining the data.frames  
 final_bike_weekly <- left_join(actual_data_bike_weekly,total_data_bike_weekly) %>% 
    mutate(excess_rentals_weekly = (actual_rental_weekly - expected_rental_weekly)/(expected_rental_weekly), #create the excess rentals percentage
    up=ifelse(actual_rental_weekly>expected_rental_weekly, excess_rentals_weekly,0),
    down=ifelse(actual_rental_weekly<expected_rental_weekly, excess_rentals_weekly, 0))

  labs(title="Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals", subtitle="% change from weekly averages \ncalculated beteen 2016-2019", x="week", y="", caption="Source: TfL, London Data Store")

```

The graph we created shows the percent change from the weekly averages of TfL bike rentals. The expected rental variable we created came from weekly data for the entire year range from 2016-2019. The actual rental variable we created was the true average for each week of each month of every year. We then created an excess rentals variable that was the percent difference between the actual and expected rentals; this is what is shown in the graph.

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

We used the mean to calculate the expected rentals. This is because we believed that the mean would provide a better representation of the data, and that when we compared our results to the actual photos of the original graphs, utilizing the mean provided a better match.
